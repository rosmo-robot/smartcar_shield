A versatile and easy to use vehicle platform for hobby & Academic projects


## Description
This repository, includes everything necessary to set up a Smartcar 2.0. The 100% open hardware robot down to component level.

The Smartcar, is a vehicular educational platform, which enables the user to develop various robotic applications in an affordable, pedagogic and easy way. It is intended to be accessible for persons with basic programming knowledge and little to no experience of electronics. It additionally supports the needs of more experienced users.

### Smartcar 1.0 (Existing)

![smartcar platform](https://i.imgur.com/cFrq2Wj.jpg)

The existing Smartcar platform is a complete hardware solution for your hobby-grade, connected vehicle project.
It is comprised of the chassis, made out of printed circuit boards, stacked on each other and an
ESP32 development board that drives the motors, controls the sensors and communicates with the
world via WiFi and Bluetooth.

There are 4 motors with directional odometers which enable not only to determine how much the
wheels have moved but also the direction they spin. See [Smartcar 1.0 documentation](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield#smartcar-shield)

The Smartcar 2.0 project is a redesign of the hardware, retaining software compatibility with the orginal platform, but adding additional hardware interfaces and additional supported software.

We hope Smartcar 2.0 interesting to makers, schools and universities. We realise there's no such thing as a universal robot platform, and there are risks in trying to be all things to all people. We however drawn to seeing what's possible with modularity and testing the edges of interoperability.
